# Train a linear ligression model 
Use X and y and claculate `mean squares error` by predicting the value of y using X.

## Write a function called `myLinearModel()`:

**Which accepts** 
- X, y (Numpy arrays for training; any format acceptable by sklearn will work)

**Returns**
A tuple of:

- mse
- Trained linear model on X and y
